# Hermes API

Welcome to the **Hermes API** repository! ðŸš€ This project is designed to serve as a flexible, scalable data pipeline that wraps around multiple public APIs. Built using **FastAPI**, the Hermes API is engineered to streamline data acquisition and transformation, making it the backbone of our data engineering processes.

## Project Overview

The Hermes API is part of the **Hermes Project**, a data engineering platform that focuses on simplifying and centralizing the integration of public APIs into a single, manageable endpoint. With Hermes, we focus on creating a **lightweight yet powerful data pipeline**, where initial payload transformations happen within the API, while heavier transformations are deferred to later stages of the data pipeline.

This API is designed with extensibility and performance in mind, leveraging **container technologies** to ensure smooth scaling as the project evolves.

## Features

- **FastAPI Framework**: Blazing fast API development with easy-to-declare endpoints, built-in validation, and automatic documentation via OpenAPI.
- **API Wrapping**: Acts as a wrapper around multiple public APIs to create a unified access point.
- **Light Data Transformations**: Initial payload transformations can be applied within the API itself, optimizing the data for downstream processes.
- **Containerized**: Designed with Docker and Kubernetes for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Future-proof**: Ready for integration of more complex data transformation pipelines and redundancy measures.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11**
- **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Uvicorn**: Lightning-fast ASGI server for running FastAPI apps.
- **yFinance**: For financial data scraping (as a placeholder API integration).
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Containerization and orchestration for scalable deployments.
